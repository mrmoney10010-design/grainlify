# Escrow View Facade

The Escrow View Facade is a read-optimized smart contract for the Grainlify ecosystem. Its goal is to aggregate views over the `BountyEscrow` core module, allowing for single-call queries while avoiding large frontend multi-call round trips.

## Architecture & Responsibilities

The Facade operates strictly as a read-only Layer-2 projection.
It does not hold any funds or mutate the underlying target contract. Integrators query the Facade, providing the instance of `BountyEscrow`, and receive structured snapshots containing amount, depositor info, pause flags, and metadata.

## Contract Endpoints

Integrators interacting with the contract have access to the following queries:

### `get_escrow_summary(env: Env, escrow_contract: Address, bounty_id: u64) -> Option<EscrowSummary>`
Fetches all relevant data associated with a specific bounty ID. Gracefully returns `None` without trapping if the ID is missing. Includes core storage mapped alongside the `EscrowMetadata`.

### `get_escrow_summaries(env: Env, escrow_contract: Address, bounty_ids: Vec<u64>) -> Vec<EscrowSummary>`
Returns a batched slice of valid summaries. Any missing IDs from the provided input array are omitted. 

### `get_user_portfolio(env: Env, escrow_contract: Address, user: Address) -> UserPortfolio`
Traverses and filters the aggregate data to compile a subset of `EscrowSummary` elements linked uniquely to a specific `soroban_sdk::Address`. Currently retrieves components where the queried user is listed directly as the depositor.

## Integration Details

Ensure the `BountyEscrow` contract address passed to the view facade has been fully initialized and active on the network.
WASM optimization bindings are hardcoded locally to mirror `BountyEscrow` definitions inside `src/bounty_escrow_bindings.rs`. Ensure to replicate schema updates if the base escrow schema undergoes major migrations.
